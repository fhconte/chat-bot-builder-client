# Bot Builder

This repository is a fork from typebot (http://www.typebot.io ! https://github.com/baptisteArno/typebot.io)

This fork is being used solely for bot flow construction. We do not use the bot list based on this repo, this is kept on another client.

Typebot is an open-source alternative to Landbot. It allows you to create conversational apps/forms (Lead qualification, Product launch, User onboarding, Customer support), embed them anywhere on your web/mobile apps, and collect results in real-time.

## Local setup

1. Clone the repo

   `git clone https://github.com/Octadesk-Tech/chat-bot-builder-client.git`

2. Set up environment variables

   Copy `apps/builder/.env.local.example` to `apps/builder/.env.local`

3. Make sure you have Docker running

4. Start the application

   `yarn && yarn dev`
   Builder is available at `http://localhost:8080/typebots/{bot_id}/edit`

   The `bot_id` parameter can be found on the bots API requests of the bot you want to edit.
   Filter the API requests of one from the V2 bots list by `/chat/bots` and copy the `bot_id` parameter.

   You can add the `channel` parameter as a query string option to check other fluxes.
   For example: `http://localhost:8080/typebots/{bot_id}/edit?channel=whatsapp`
